  'A national study to understand how Black churches, pastors, leaders, and congregations are thinking about artificial intelligence.',
  'Artificial Intelligence is rapidly reshaping how people communicate, learn, work, and make decisions—and the church cannot afford to be absent from that conversation. Yet while national studies continue to explore AI adoption across faith communities, the Black Church is often missing from the data, despite its historic role as a leader in shaping culture, community, justice, and spiritual formation. The State of AI in the Black Church Survey was created to help change that. This national study seeks to better understand how Black churches, pastors, leaders, and congregations are thinking about artificial intelligence, where it is already being used, what concerns exist, and what opportunities may lie ahead. Our goal is simple: to ensure that the voice, values, wisdom, and realities of the Black Church are represented in one of the most important technological conversations of our time.',
